##  R's grid graphic model

Personal notes about the *grid* package in R based on the books *R Graphics* by Paul Murrel (second edition) and *Mastering Software Development in R* by Roger D. Peng, Sean Kross, and Brooke Anderson.

##  Organization of the Files

The project has the following structure:
  * **_RESOURCES**: The contents of this folder are the following:
    * **_VIGNETTES**: Contains all the vignettes of the grid package.
  * **_TEXTS**: Consists of all my notes.
